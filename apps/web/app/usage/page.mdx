import { NextSteps } from "./next-steps";

# Usage

Once you've installed the package and configured it, you can start using it.

Import it from `suspense-fallback-debugger`:
```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'suspense-fallback-debugger';
```

Since it's based on React's `<Suspense/>` API, it works exactly the same—you don't need to worry about new implementation details.

You can always check the **[React documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)** for more information.

When you use it, the `<DevTools/>` component automatically catches it and displays the fallbacks.

## Migrate from React Suspense

If you're currently using `<Suspense/>` from React, you can migrate to `<Suspense/>` from `suspense-fallback-debugger` easily.

Replace the `<Suspense/>` import from `react` with `suspense-fallback-debugger`:

**Before:**
```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';

export function YourComponent() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <AwaitedComponent />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

**After:**
```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'suspense-fallback-debugger';

export function YourComponent() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <AwaitedComponent />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

We kept the same API as the original `<Suspense/>` component, so you can migrate your code by only changing the import.
