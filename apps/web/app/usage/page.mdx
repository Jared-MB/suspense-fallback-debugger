# Usage

Once you've installed the package and configured it, you can start using it.

Import it from `suspense-fallback-debugger`:

```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'suspense-fallback-debugger';
```

Since is based on current `<Suspense/>` react API, it works exactly the same, so you don´t need to worry about new implementation details.
And always you can check the **[react documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)** for more information.

When you use it, the `<DevDropdown/>` component will automatically catches it and you can start showing the fallbacks.

## Migrate from React Suspense

If you are currently using **\<Suspense/>** from **react**, you can migrate to **\<Suspense/>** from **suspense-fallback-debugger** easily.

Replace **\<Suspense/>** import from `react` to `suspense-fallback-debugger`

Before:

```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';

export function YourComponent(){
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <YourComponent />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

After:

```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'suspense-fallback-debugger';

export function YourComponent(){
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <YourComponent />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

And that's it!
